<p><b>Introduction</b></p>

This paper examines the production of object clitics in sequential bilingual children acquiring L2 French (L1 English) compared to monolingual children with SLI. Difficulties with object clitic pronouns have been argued to be a clinical marker of SLI in monolingual children, but it is unclear whether the same difficulties can be used to accurately identify SLI in bilingual children. One major challenge in addressing this issue involves the role of length of exposure to the L2 (LoE). The main objective of this paper is to shed light on the impact of LoE on object clitic performance in sequential bilingual children (henceforth, L2 children) and how it affects the overlap between typically developing (TD) L2 children and children with SLI.
