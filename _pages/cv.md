Research Interests
======
My research focuses on bilingual language development. I am particularly interested in the acquisition of French in sequential and simultaneous bilinguals, as well as in children with typical and atypical development.

I am currently working on a SSHRC-funded project (Language Experience and Linguistic Complexity in Child Bilingual Development: A Cross-learner Comparison) which focuses on the impact of language exposure on various language measures (sentence repetition, non-word repetition and standardized tests) in children acquiring French in early total immersion and in francophone school settings.

Teaching Interests:
======
I hold a joint appointment in the Department of Linguistics and the Department of Modern Languages, Literatures and Cultures. I teach classes in linguistics as well as French language courses at both the intermediate and advanced levels.
